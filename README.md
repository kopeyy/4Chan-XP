# 4Chan-XP
4Chan XP is an extension that helps you switch proxies with ease on 4chan

## Some notes before using
"Clear cookies" option clears cookies before you post, but it will keep the theme cookie so that you won't have to reselect it each time.

The new captcha relies on your IP and cookies as far as I know, therefore trying to post with a captcha that was solved before you toggled the proxy will not work.
Always solve captchas **AFTER** you toggle the proxy.
